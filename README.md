## Why SRP Cards?

After stroke, recovery depends on consistent exercise. But accessing rehabilitation is hard: therapists are expensive, transportation is difficult, and patients often have cognitive or vision challenges. Caregivers lack training. Exercise sheets are confusing. Recovery stalls.

**Stroke Recovery Program Cards put evidence-based rehabilitation directly into the hands of patients and caregivers.** Personalized. Accessible. Printable. Low-cost. Works anywhere.

## Features

- **4 Exercise Categories**: Hand (★), Shoulder (●), Arm (■), Leg (▲)
- **Multiple Output Formats**: 4 on 1 page, large single cards, icons only
- **Accessibility First**: Colorblind-safe Okabe-Ito palette, large typography, shape + number ID
- **Two Interfaces**: Browser (caregiver-friendly) + CLI (power users)
- **Works Offline**: No internet, no subscriptions, no cloud dependency
- **Print & Laminate**: A4 landscape, laminate-friendly for daily goal tracking

## Quick Start

### Browser (No Installation)

1. Open `web/index.html` in any browser
2. Create a personalized exercise program in 5 minutes
3. Print, laminate, track progress

### Command Line

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate card set: 4 cards on 1 page
python3 cli/exercise-sheet -1 hand_0 -2 shoulder_1 -3 arm_2 -4 leg_0 -o output.pdf

# Generate large cards: 1 per page (2x size, easier to read)
python3 cli/exercise-sheet -1 hand_0 -2 shoulder_1 -3 arm_2 -4 leg_0 --layout single -o output.pdf
```

## Exercise Library

| Category | Icon | Color | Exercises |

## Who Is This For?

### Stroke Patients
Clear daily structure. Accessible design that works even with vision or memory challenges. Track progress and build confidence on your own timeline.

### Caregivers
No PT background needed. Generate a personalized exercise routine in 5 minutes. Print it. Laminate it. Your patient does 1-2 cards daily. You track completion.

### Clinical Administrators
Standardize exercise delivery across your facility. Generate customized cards for each patient. Evidence-based, accessible, scalable.

## Design System

- **Colorblind Safe**: Okabe-Ito palette — distinguishable for all color vision types
- **Large Typography**: 24pt steps, 22pt headings, 0.8cm line spacing
- **Shape + Number ID**: ★1, ●2, ■3, ▲4 — instant identification for cognitive accessibility
- **Goal Tracking Box**: 2.2cm box (top-right) with category-matched border for daily checkmarks
- **Laminate Friendly**: Works with dry-erase markers on laminated sheets

git clone https://github.com/bayanimills/SRP-Cards---Stroke-Recovery-Program-Cards.git
cd SRP-Cards---Stroke-Recovery-Program-Cards

pip install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x cli/exercise-sheet

# Open caregiver interface
open web/index.html
```

## Usage

### Browser Interface

1. Open `web/index.html`
2. Enter patient name and ability level
3. Select one exercise per category
4. Choose output format (4-on-1 or large cards)
5. Generate & Print

### CLI Reference

```
-1, --pos1 TYPE_INDEX    Hand exercise (e.g., hand_0)
-2, --pos2 TYPE_INDEX    Shoulder exercise

## FAQ

**Q: Can I add my own exercises?**
A: Currently, you modify the Python script. A web-based editor is on the roadmap.

**Q: Is internet required?**
A: No. Both web interface and CLI work completely offline.

**Q: What if a patient is colorblind?**
A: The Okabe-Ito palette is tested to be distinguishable for all color vision types. The shape + number system provides redundant identification.

**Q: Can I track patient progress?**
A: Laminate the cards and use dry-erase markers for daily goal tracking. Digital progress tracking is on the roadmap.
